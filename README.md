So this is the backend for the recipe-book app (name subject to change). I made the front end the master branch before I learned how to do backend. so yeah there will be 2 repositories. oops! ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

This backend was created using express and is used to connect mysql, cloudinary, bcrypt, and other backend operations to my front end recipe website.

READ The-recipe-book-client's README to learn about the website.
